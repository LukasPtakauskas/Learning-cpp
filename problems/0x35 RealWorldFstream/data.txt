Jewelry with stones already set (including rings, amulets, earrings, etc.), are readily available based on the gemstone
availability, at the DM's discretion. Suggestions for gemstone values and descriptions are available in the DMG on page 134.
The “Powdering of Gems” service is an as needed task as most places aren’t interested in keeping smashed up gemstones on
hand. Some bigger locations may keep a few of the less valuable gems already powdered and bagged, but most places will do
it on an as needed basis. More often than not, the customer would need to provide the gem in addition to paying the fee
listed in the chart.
As with all locations, some services may have items not shown typically available on this chart or may offer services not
typical for the area. These may come at a higher premium or be a service they only offer as a special reward for a job they
need done as well.

Important note ‘Gem Shop’ prices are based off a system of size vs. price. Gem prices are sold at full size (Default price in the
DMG guide located on page 134) and as such the price by gem size can be altered to suit your needs. “I.e. Large = 1:1,
Medium = 1:10, Small = 1:100, Tiny = 1:1000”.
To use this in an example for spell casting ‘Chromatic Orb – 1st level, Evocation’ requires ‘A Diamond worth at least 50 gp’ so
in this case a default 1:1 Large Diamond is worth 5000 gp and as such “5000/50=100” so in this case a 1:100 Small diamond is
worth the required 50 gp to cast the spell. smaller items.

General Notes
- Meal & Inn prices are based on Chapter 5 of the PHB, “Lifestyle Expenses”. If you have a character who is a heavy drinker,
maybe only one drink is included. I did not use the same page for Market Produce given the additions made.
- All meals are served with a bread slice, a side & drink unless a side is already listed beside it.

General Notes
•
A partial list of elemental aligned inks: Fire, Ice, Water, Air, Electricity, Acid, Forest & Poison. Wizards
are developing inks all over the planet. Some have yet to be perfected, some are regional.
•
Note on Forest aligned elemental ink: This ink is normally used in the Mark of the Dryad & Spider, or
Pack masters & Snake charmer’s Mark. Mark of the Flock can use Air or Forest.
•
Tattoos denoted as having a special locale are performed only by those who specialize in that form.
(Ex. Tattoo of the Frozen Fist would only be available in select monasteries in frozen regions.)
